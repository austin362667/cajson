# Cajson

Cajson is a programming inspired by C and JavaScript. 

Programming language can be devided into strong typed and weak typed.

Strong typed language, such as C/C++/C#/Java are hard to write but run fast.

Weak typed language, such as Python/JavaScript are easy to write but run slow.

Cajson try to mix strong typed and weak typed syntax into one language.

In cajson, weak typed function are easy to write but run slow. 

However, if you add type to every variable in a function, it will run as fast as C.
